I am a  postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia. I am very fortunate to be mentored by Professors Micheal Friedlander, Yaniv Plan, and Ozgur Yilmaz.  I have worked on signal recovery problems in clustering and parameter estimation. I use ideas and results from high dimensional geometry and high dimensional probability to find and analyze convex and non-convex programs; providing a theoretical recovery guarantee for these programs.
